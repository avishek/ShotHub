          <p>Welcome to the <b>ShotHub</b> Blog! We decided to use this platform to share our journey with all of you, our most enthusiastic fans!</p>
          <p>As many others, we started <b>ShotHub</b> with an inspiration and the desire to solve a problem. We envision to build the world's most efficient tool for personal health management. There has never been anyone who could do this job well.</p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Can you recall all the vaccinations and shots you have taken?</li>
            <li>Have you ever wondered if you have taken all 3 shots of Hepatitis B?</li>
            <li>Do you know what shots you should take before travelling and what they are for?</li>
            <li>Do you understand why you have to take those shots or you simply do it because your doctors told you so?</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>If you answered "No" to any of these questions, we want you to try our product!</p>
          <p><b>ShotHub</b> is all about helping you take better care of yourselves and your loved ones. If you are a frequent traveller, we would love you to try our product first. As frequent travellers ourselves, we often wonder what we can do to take care of ourselves before travelling. Before I flew to India, I was totally freaked out by the number of shots recommended to me by my doctor. Some were compulsory, some were not but I took all anyway! However, after that I had no idea what I took and totally forgot about the many precautions I should take after those shots. That was when I wished I had something to remind me of what I took, let me know what they did and tell me what to do after taking those! We finally formed a team to solve a problem that we had in common.</p>
          <p>There should be a central place for you to keep track of all your medications, vaccinations and shots. Before I travel, it should let me know what I should take and when should I do it. If my brother is travelling with me and he is too lazy to do it, I want to help him do that. And hey, how about <b>ShotHub</b> telling me where I can take these shots at the cheapest price or where is nearest to my location?</p>
          <p>We are jazzed by our imagination of how useful this is going to be. We will update you with our progress of building this tool and hope to receive your comments and feedback along the way! :)</p>
